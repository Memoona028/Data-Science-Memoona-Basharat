Starting with Data Science
Data
Data often refers to raw facts which further need to be analyze in order to generate information 
and decision in several contexts such as business, science and our everyday life. It can be a list of 
phone numbers or records of patients present in hospital etc.
Definition of Data Science
1. Data science aims to extract knowledge and insights from data using scientific methods 
like probability and statistics, including more than just traditional statistics.
2. The knowledge gained from data science should lead to actionable insights that can be 
applied into real-world business scenarios.
3. Data scientists must handle both structured and unstructured data and often need to 
have expertise in specific application domains such as finance, medicine, or marketing 
etc.
Types of Data
1- Structured
Data which is highly organized and easily searchable, typically stored in databases or 
spreadsheets i.e. List of people with their phone numbers.
2- Semi-Structured
Data that does not reside in a traditional database but has some organizational properties that 
make it easier to analyze. i.e. Collection of scientific papers in .Json format with authors, date of 
publication etc.
3- Unstructured
Data that lacks a predefined format, structure or organization, making it more challenging to 
collect, process, and analyze i.e. Raw video feed from a camera.
Where to get data?
About getting data, it depends on, in which format we want if want to have. For structured data, 
we should go for source which stores data in some specific format such as Relational databases 
& surveys etc. Next for Unstructured format we can get data from images, videos and logs etc. 
Semi-structured data can be available to us by Social Networks.
What can we do with data?
After acquiring data, we store it in our databases then preprocess in order to transform it into 
some structured format for further steps like for visualization and training some predictive model 
which requires data to be stable and standardize in order to give good results
